Thesis Project consists of 3 parts:

- Extraction of refined skeletal data from THETIS dataset (Skeletal_extraction file)
	A program that extracts the skeletal data of every movement each tennis player performs.
	The data refinement is achieved using a weighted average of the coordinates 
	that are extracted after every movement/action video is repeated for a given number 
	of times.
	Implementation using the library of OpenNI/Nite (C++).

- Skeletal data visualization using unity (Scripts_unity)
	A simple visualization of skeletal coordinates for every frame in each video of THETIS dataset. 
	This is made for a simple check on how valid the skeletons' movement is during the demonstration
	of the tennis actions. 

- Implementation of an activity recognition system (Activity_Recognition_Implementation)
	The algorithm that was implemented is based on paper:
		Enea Cippitelli Samuele Gasparrini, Ennio Gambi-Susanna Spinsante (2016). 
		“A Human Activity Recognition System Using Skeleton Data from RGBD Sensors”. 
		In: Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
	Implementation using matlab.
	The purpose of the implementation is to compare the activity recognition performance of 
	skeletal data to other forms of data, that have been extracted from THETIS dataset
